[*by Vanderlei C. Oliveira Jr.*](https://www.pinga-lab.org/people/oliveira-jr.html)

This is an invited presentation for the [Geo-Kolloquium](https://tu-freiberg.de/geo-kolloquium)
of the TU Bergakademie Freiberg, Germany. The presentation is
focused on the theoretical aspects supporting the potential-field
