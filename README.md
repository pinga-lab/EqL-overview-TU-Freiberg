# Processing and interpreting potential-field data via Equivalent-Layer Technique

[*by Vanderlei C. Oliveira Jr.*](https://www.pinga-lab.org/people/oliveira-jr.html)

This is an invited presentation made for the [Geo-Kolloquium](https://tu-freiberg.de/geo-kolloquium), at the 
TU Bergakademie Freiberg, Germany, about the **Equivalent-Layer Technique** for
processing and interpreting gravity and magnetic data. The presentation is
focused on the theoretical aspects supporting the potential-field
transformations usually performed via equivalent layer.
